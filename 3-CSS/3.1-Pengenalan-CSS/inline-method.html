          Ai Hayasaka is one of the side characters from
          <i>Kaguya Sama : Love Is War</i> Series, which her role is to become
          Shinomiya Kaguya's Personal Maid. She study at the same school as
          Shinomiya Kaguya too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ai is based on <i>Tsuki no Iwakasa (つきの岩笠)</i>, a servant from
          The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter who burned the Elixir of Immortality on
          Mount Fuji at the orders of the Emperor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hayasaka family was once prominent, but lost their conflict to the
          Shinomiya family and, noted for their outstanding bloodline, were
          absorbed into it. Ai was born in the Shinomiya family's main house as
          a thoroughbred servant and was given special education. She was born
          into and grew up in an isolated world like Kaguya Shinomiya was, but
          Ai is less sheltered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ai's father is Kaguya's godfather, and her mother was Kaguya's wet
          nurse. They were raised together for a short period after their
          births. Still, Kaguya was moved to the Shinomiya main house on her
          second birthday, and they were only reunited at the age of seven when
          their status as master and servant was made official. Their
          master/servant relationship is only on the surface. However, their
          actual relationship more resembles that of inseparable sisters. Kaguya
          gave Ai a scrunchie while asking to be her friend. While Ai refused,
          she did use the hair tie, and it is the main accessory of hers.

          Ai is a beautiful young girl with blonde hair that is usually tied up
          at the left side of her head with a blue scrunchie and blue-eyes. She
          alters her appearance and choice of clothing to suit different roles
          and carry out her duties as Kaguya's maid.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wears a maid outfit when tending to the Shinomiya household. As a
          student at Shuchi'in Academy, she wears a modified high school uniform
          to match up with kogal fashion and a sweater wrapped around her waist.
          As Haysaca-chan, she dresses up in a Firis Girls' High sailor uniform
          with her hair down and a small braid tied on the right side, while as
          Haysaca-kun, she sports a butler uniform and a short, black hair wig.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the class trip, she cut off her ponytail to prevent one of
          Un'yo Shinomiya's men from continuing to hold on to it. She ends up
          styling it into a bob with a star and crescent moon hairpin on the
          left side, her old scrunchie now being used as a wristband on her left
          hand.

          Despite her young age, Ai can quickly shift to different types of
          personalities to suit various kinds of situations and scenarios. She
          has four distinct personas which, aside from having a specific
          purpose, has its own unique background and upbringing.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a maid, she is level-headed who carries out duties flawlessly and
          while she occasionally give her mistress grief over her absurd
          demands, she still loves her deeply. In her school camouflage version,
          she is a fashion-conscious schoolgirl with a penchant for
          rule-breaking and her liveliness is her trademark. The anti-Miyuki
          version, Haysaca-chan, is a doe-eyed maneater who picks up men in
          Roppongi and Azabu and leads them around by the nose. Haysaca-kun
          exists to counter the unpredictable Chika Fujiwara and has the
          backstory of an Irish orphan who later graduated at Harvard then ended
          up as a butler who becomes a crybaby when remembering his past.
        </p>
        <p>
          In reality, she is just a kind girl who deeply loves her mistress,
          whom she considers a sister and is willing to go against the Shinomiya
          house within reason like sneaking Kaguya out of the main house to see
          the summer fireworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          She is also known to be very sensitive about the fact that she never
          had any experience of dating a guy. Since the Kyoto class trip,
          Hayasaka seems to have dropped her gyaru persona around her friends,
          who now see her as somewhat distant and harsh. They interpret this as
          a sign of heartbreak.
